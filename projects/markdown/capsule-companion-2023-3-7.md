# Intro

This project is a combination of a therapist bot and pill dispenser, designed to be used with a hologram interface. The hologram interface allows for a more interactive and engaging experience, and the therapist bot provides personalized support and guidance to users.

# Inspiration

We decided to let our project idea fall in the hands of AI. We consulted with ChatGPT for an ungodly amount of time and landed on the project presented before you. Because ChatGPT can be a little silly, we had to modify the idea to it was feasible in the time frame provided.

# How We Made It

## Body

We decided to use woodworking as our main means of making our project. This was advantages as it was both fast and resulted in an amazing finished product. We also learned how to make stickers for our team logo.

## Electronics

This was the first time working with an Arduino for most of our team members. It was an amazing project to learn about servos and serial communication protocols.

# Features

Personalized therapy sessions: The therapist bot uses natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to provide customized therapy sessions based on user input.

Pill dispenser: The hologram interface also doubles as a pill dispenser, which can be programmed to dispense pills at specific times. For some users, especially those who may have difficulty remembering to take their medication or may require specific dosages at certain times. The visual reminder that the robot provides can also be helpful for individuals with cognitive or memory impairments.

Voice recognition: The bot uses the Whisper API for voice-to-text recognition and the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API for its responses.

Secure and confidential: The user's data is encrypted and stored securely to protect their privacy.

# Usage

Talk to the therapist bot: The bot will prompt the user for input and provide responses based on the input.

Program the pill dispenser: The user can program the pill dispenser to dispense pills at specific times.

End the session: The user can end the session by saying "Goodbye" or "Exit".
