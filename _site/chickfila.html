<h2 id="how-to-order-at-chick-fil-a">How to Order at Chick-Fil-A</h2>

<p>Most customers at Chick-Fil-A have never been behind the counter at the POS systems. Because of this, most customers say their order in a non-desirable order which makes it harder for new team members to take the order. Because of this disconnect from customer to POS system, a set of instructions for customers to follow would be the best option. These manuals would be shown next to the menus and or on the back of the POS systems.</p>

<p>The purpose of this manual is to allow our store to increase speed of order taking. This increase in speed would mean more customers would be able to get through our line faster which would end up being more profit for the franchise.</p>

<p>A word of caution when setting up this instruction set. Customers may get aggravated when they notice they canâ€™t order in a non-uniform way anymore. If this is to happen, just remind them that these instructions are necessary to get them there food faster.</p>

<p>The manual infographic should be used to remind returning customers how to order, and the manual can be given out to new customers with their first order.</p>

<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>

<h3 id="location-of-dining">Location of Dining</h3>
<p>The team member taking an order will see a screen similar to the figure 1. This will be one of first prompt that the team member sees, so it is important that the customer states if they are dining in or carrying out near the beginning of the ordering process.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/fig1.png" /> fig1</p>

<h3 id="starting-an-order">Starting an Order</h3>
<p>After the location of dining has been stated, the team member will most likely ask for a name. The team member will be looking at a screen similar to figure 2. A customer should state their name at this step and that is all.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/fig2.png" /> fig2</p>

<p>If the customer is ordering carry out, they should give the team member a little bit of time here as they will also need to enter some identifying information as shown in figure 3. This ensures that Chick-Fil-A can get the order to the correct person if multiple people with the same name are waiting for carry out.</p>
