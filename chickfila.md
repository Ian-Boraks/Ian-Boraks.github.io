## How to Order at Chick-Fil-A

Most customers at Chick-Fil-A have never been behind the counter at the POS systems. Because of this, most customers say their order in a non-desirable order which makes it harder for new team members to take the order. Because of this disconnect from customer to POS system, a set of instructions for customers to follow would be the best option. These manuals would be shown next to the menus and or on the back of the POS systems.

The purpose of this manual is to allow our store to increase speed of order taking. This increase in speed would mean more customers would be able to get through our line faster which would end up being more profit for the franchise.

A word of caution when setting up this instruction set. Customers may get aggravated when they notice they canâ€™t order in a non-uniform way anymore. If this is to happen, just remind them that these instructions are necessary to get them there food faster.

The manual infographic should be used to remind returning customers how to order, and the manual can be given out to new customers with their first order.

## Steps

### Location of Dining
